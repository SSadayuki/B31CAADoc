/**
 * Class for visualizing temporary objects in given viewers.
 * <b>Role</b>: Usually you put into the Interactive Set Objects (ISO), objects that are related
 * to the current command. Thus it allows you to give temporaries information to the end-user.
 * <br>The object, to set into the ISO, are components which implement either @href CATI3DGeoVisu 
 * either @href CATI2DGeoVisu, two default interfaces of the Visualization Framework. 
 * <br>To avoid to create a new component, you can use a @href CATModelForRep2D or 
 * or a @href CATModelForRep3D. These 2 components already implement the visualization 
 * interfaces.
 *<p>
 * There are three default CATISO in every editor:
 *<ol>
 *<li> a normal   CATISO</li>
 *<li> a furtive  CATISO</li>
 *<li> a background CATISO</li>
 *</ol>
