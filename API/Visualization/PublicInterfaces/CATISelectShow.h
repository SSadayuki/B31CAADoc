/** 
 * Interface for managing the hide/show command.
 * <b>Role</b> : This interface has two goals.
 * <ol>
 * <li> The hide/show command works on @href CATPathElement, and 
 * puts in show or noshow the last object of the pathelement
 * which implements CATISelectShow. So, if you want the hide/show command
 * to work on your object, it is necessary to implement <tt>CATISelectShow</tt>.</li>
 * <li> You can implement your own function @href #GetElementForHideShow . This way,
 * the hide/show command will put in show or noshow the object
 * returned by this function. This second goal is optional.</li>
 *</ol>
 * NB : When the hide/show command puts in show or noshow an object,
 * it uses the interface @href CATIVisProperties on this object.
 * <p><b>BOA information</b>: this interface CANNOT be implemented
 * using the BOA (Basic Object Adapter).
 * To know more about the BOA, refer to the CAA Encyclopedia home page.
 * Click Middleware at the bottom left, then click the Object Modeler tab page.
 * Several articles deal with the BOA.</p>
