/**
 * Base class for a State Command.
 * <b>Role</b>: A State Command is a command modeled as a state machine.
 * It is a graph made of states linked between them using incoming and
 * outgoing transitions. 
 * The states are composed of dialog agents which let the end user input the
 * requested parameters. 
 * Conditions may be associated with states and transitions in order to 
 * guide the progression according to the user inputs. Actions are linked
 * to states and transition to execute the know-how of the command.
 * <br>
 * To create a State Command, derive the <tt>CATStateCommand</tt> class and 
 * override the methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>@href CATCommand#Activate </li>
 * <li>@href CATCommand#Desactivate </li>
 * <li>@href CATCommand#Cancel </li>
 * </ul>
 * if needed to manage the activation cycle and above all
 * <ul>
 * <li>@href #BuildGraph </li> called once before the first @href 
 * CATCommand#Activate method
 * </ul>
 * in order to build the state chart.
 * <p>
 * <b>Life cycle</b>
 * <p>
 * In general, a main State Command is allocated by the command header
 * and is deallocated by the internal focus mechanism.
 * <br>A main State Command ends when:
 * <ul>
 * <li>another exclusive command is activated:
 * the State Command is cancelled by the focus manager.</li>
 * <li>the NULL state is reached:
 * the State Command cancels itself.</li>
 * <li>the Cancel state is reached:
 * same as the NULL state, but a global Undo is executed.</li>
 * <li>the @href CATCommand#RequestDelayedDestruction method is called:
 * a good State Command prefers to use transitions towards the NULL state.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Error Management during execution</b>
 * <p>
 * Exceptions thrown during condition evaluation or action execution must be caught
 * by the condition methods or the action methods.
 * <br>Nevertheless, if DialogEngine catches one, the main State Command is desactivated
 * while a default error dialog box displays information about the error.
 * Then the main State Command resumes after the error dialog box is closed.
 *
