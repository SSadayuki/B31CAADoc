/**
 * Class defining an operator that duplicates the touched cells (and the cells depending on these
 * touched cells) of a body.
 * <br>This is used in the context of the "smart mechanism".
 * After its creation a CATTopology is modifiable.
  *   It becomes non-modifiable when a body containing it is frozen.
  *   The smart duplicator only duplicates the touched cells and 
  *   the domains impacted by the touched cells.
	*<br>As any operator, the duplicator is created, run, read,and deleted.
	* Sample:
	* <pre>// anEdge is a cell belonging to FrozenBody.
	*	anEdge->Touch(FrozenBody);
	* //  Create an empty body to input the duplicated cells
	* CATBody * NewBody= CATGeoCreateBody(GeoFactory);
	*	CATICGMSmartBodyDuplicator * SmartDupl=NewBody->CreateISmartDuplicator(FrozenBody);
	*	SmartDupl->Run();
	* // Retrieves the mapping between the touched edge and its copy:
	* CATEdge * DuplicatedEdge = (CATEdge *)	(SmartDupl->GetDuplicatedCell(anEdge));
	* // clean the memory
	*	SmartDupl->Release();</pre>
    * <br>NOTE:
    * <br>Throughout this header documentation, 
    * the term "lying on link" refers to a piece of information which is contained in
    * the cell to be duplicated. This piece of information gives a clue as to whether
    * the duplicated cell is lying on the cell the original cell was lying on (the link).  
    *  .
