/**
 * Class defining the operator for testing the inclusion of a point
 * in a surface.
 * <br>The inclusion is tested within a given tolerance. The operator gets all
 * the points closed enough (at the tolerance) to the surface, spaced 
 * each other by a curvilinear distance at least equal to <tt>2*Tol</tt>.
 * This operator is optimized for low values of <tt>Tol</tt>. It differs from the
 * CATICGMDistanceMinPtSur operator, that only outputs one point realizing
 * the minimum distance without tolerance.
 *<ul>
 *<li>The CATICGMInclusionPtSur operator is created with the <tt>CATCGMCreateInclusion</tt> method and 
 * directly released with the <tt>Release</tt> method.
 * It is is not streamable. 
 *<li>In case of <tt>BASIC</tt>
 * mode, the operation is automatically performed at the operator creation. 
 * In case of <tt>ADVANCED</tt>
 * mode, options can be precised with the <tt>SetXxx</tt> methods, before
 * asking for the computation with the <tt>Run</tt> method. The advanced mode also allows you to
 * run the same operator with different points.
 *<li>In both cases, the result is accessed with a specific interator.
