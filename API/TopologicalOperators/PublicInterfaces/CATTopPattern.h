/**
* Class dedicated to pattern operations. 
* The pattern operation consists in creating multiple instances of an object
* according to a transformation. 
* A pattern can be a:
* <ul>
* <li>user pattern: the way the object is repeated is defined by a list of transformations
* which is specified in the operator creation function.
* <li>a rectangular pattern which is created by repeating an object along two directions. 
* <li>a circular pattern is created by repeating an object around an axis at various distances.
* </ul>
* <p>
* Whatever the pattern type, the list of tranformations is to be specified. 
* For rectangular and circular patterns, it is recommended to use the <tt>SetRectPattern<\tt>
* and <tt>SetCirPattern<\tt> settings in addition to the list of transformations passed to the creation function.
* This prevents the operator algorithm to launch useless computations. The performances are then enhanced.
* <p>
* The <tt>CATTopPattern</tt> operator follows the global frame of topological operators and satisfies the smart mechanism: 
* the input bodies are not modified. A new resulting body is created, 
* possibly sharing data with the input body.
* <ul>
* <li>A <tt>CATTopPattern</tt> operator is created with the <tt>CATCreateTopPattern</tt> global method:
* It must be directly <tt>delete</tt>d after use. It is not streamable. 
* <li>Options can be precised with the <tt>SetXxx</tt> methods, before
* asking for the computation with the <tt>Run</tt> method
* <li>The result is accessed with the <tt>GetResult</tt> method. If you do not want 
* to keep the resulting body, use the @href CATICGMContainer#Remove method to remove it from the 
* geometric factory. 
* </ul>
