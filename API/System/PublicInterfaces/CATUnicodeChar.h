/**
 * Unicode character support. 
 * <b>Role</b>: Unicode character class. Use CATUnicodeChar whenever you need to manipulate a single character, for
 * example when using a CATUnicodeString.

 */
/** 
 * Class to use for language meaningful character. 
 * <b>Role</b>:
 * CATUnicodeChar can be used whenever a character is needed, and that is either seen, entered, or manipulated by the 
 * end user. In this way, the client application is shielded from implementation details regarding language, locale,
 * bytecoding of characters, and so forth. Client applications thus become portable since they can handle character
 * strings expressed in any language.
 * <p>
 * When NLS support is not required, you can use instead the @href CATChar class from the System framework. It does
 * support only ISO 646, so that to supress all the problems that arise with NLS complexity. You should never use the 
 * raw char type.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note</b>: Among the methods to manipulate instances of this class, you will find below some references to the
 * Unicode and UTF-8 standards. See @href CATUnicodeString for precisions.
 * <p><b>Note</b>: You will find also below some references to the SBCS and MBCS acronym, see @href CATUnicodeString
 * for precisions.
 * <p><b>CAUTION</b>: The methods manipulating the "char" type of the C language (or "char*", see 
 * @href CATUnicodeChar#BuildFromChar ) should rarely be used. They may be used:
 * <ul>
 * <li>combined with the use of Unix MOTIF services</li>
 * <li>to display debug traces on the stdout</li>
 * </ul>
 * The best way to manipulate strings is to use the Unicode encoding, the "char" type of the C language has many
 * limitations.
 * <br>Suppose, for example, you call @href CATUnicodeChar#BuildFromChar on Windows, and, during the execution, the
 * given "char*" contains one byte, B1 in hexa, followed by the NULL byte which ends the string. Then, 
 * @href CATUnicodeChar#BuildFromChar will behave the following way:
 * <ul>
 * <li>if the General\"Settings for the current user" field in the "Control Panel"\"Regional Options" window is set to
 * English, the built CATUnicodeChar will contain the "PLUS-MINUS SIGN" character</li>
 * <li>if it set on Japanese, the built CATUnicodeChar will contain the "HALFWIDTH KATAKANA LETTER A" character:
 * the B1 code belongs to the range of one-byte code representations</li>
 * <li>if it set on Korean, the built CATUnicodeChar will contain the "QUESTION MARK" character, which is the default
 * character. Actually, the B1 code belongs to the range of two-bytes code representations</li>
 * </ul>
