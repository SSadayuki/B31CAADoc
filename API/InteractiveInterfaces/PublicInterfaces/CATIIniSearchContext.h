	/**
   * Contexts value for a Search procedure.
   * <br>The following contexts are allowed:
   * @param Everywhere
   *    To look for objects located anywhere in the document.
   * @param InUIActiveObject
   *    To look for objects located between the current UIActive object (called current
   *    top object) and the next UIActivable objects located below this top object
   *    (called current bottom objects). Those objects are also included in the Search process.
   *    <br>In a Part document, in a Part Design context, this
   *    context will consider all the objects from the top of the specification
   *    tree, to the sketches (included). But it would not take into account
   *    the elements of each sketch.
   * @param FromUIActiveObjectToBottom
   *    To look for objects located from the current top object (included in the Search
   *    process), to the very bottom of the specification tree for the current top object's branch.
   *    <br>In a Product document, in a Part Design context, this
   *    context will consider all the objects from the current Part object to 
   *    its constitutive sketches, and all their elements.
   * @param FromSelection
   *    To look for objects located in the current set of objects of the editor ( @href CATCSO ), 
   *    as well as other objects located underneath in the specification tree.
   *    <br>For example, let us consider a Part document where a hole object 
   *    and a pad object are selected. The Search process will confront the hole,
   *    the pad, their sketches, and constitutive elements to the criterion.
   * @param OnSameLevel
   *    To look for objects located on the same specification tree level as a 
   *    reference object.
   *    <br>This reference object is excluded from the search result.
   *    <br>It is only possible to define this scope through the @href #SetScope method.
   *    When doing so, the second argument of the method must be provided.
   *    <br>In addition, there is no possible print out of this scope's NLS or 
   *    TransFormat value.
   * @param VisibleOnScreen
   *    To look for objects visible (fully or not) in the current active window.
   *    <br>This context won’t take into account elements not activated, not represented
   *    (features used to build other features that appear in the specification tree but
   *    not in 3D), not in the current active filter, not in the current mask... and when
   *    the 2D mode will be activated elements not in the active plane will be excluded from
   *    the search result too.
   *    <br>Caution: do not use this scope in a batch, the result would be unpredictable.
   * <br><br>The default scope, i.e. if no setup is made, is <tt>InUIActiveObject</tt>
