/**
 * Class to create instances of geometric constraint solver called CDS.
 * <b>Role</b>: CATICDS is used to position geometric objects (such as points,
 * lines, planes, and others) in 3D space under logical and dimensional
 * constraints (such as coincidence, tangency, distance, and others).
 * Besides the main functionality, it implements also dynamic evaluation,
 * degrees of freedom analysis, overdefined diagnostics, kinematic simulation,
 * and other actions.
 * The geometric problem is formulated in terms of objects (instances of
 * classes derived from <tt>CATICDSGeometry</tt>) and constraints (instances of
 * classes derived from <tt>CATICDSGeomConstraint</tt>), also called callbacks
 * (since usually they are implemented the corresponding interface on the
 * application side).
 * They are passed to the solver with <tt>AddXXX</tt> methods, then
 * the method <tt>Run</tt> should be called to position of given objects
 * under given set of constraints.
 * Once a solution is found, the solver calls the corresponding methods
 * of each object to re-position it or to change its shape and dimensions.
 * After <tt>Run</tt>, some <tt>GetXXX</tt> methods can be called to gather
 * the information on objects and constraint statuses, their degrees of
 * freedom, etc.
 * <tt>SetXXX</tt> methods can be called before <tt>Run</tt> to specify
 * different solving modes.
 * All objects and constraints passed to the solver will be automatically
 * deleted when the instance of the solver is deleted.
