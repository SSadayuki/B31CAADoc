/**
* Constructs an operator that mutually trims two bodies.

* If there is not any portion of <tt>iFirstBodyToCut</tt> anymore, the orientation of the domains in the resulting body corresponds to the orientation

* @param iFactory
* The pointer to the factory of the geometry.
* @param iData
* The pointer to the data defining the software configuration and the journal. If the journal inside <tt>iData</tt>
