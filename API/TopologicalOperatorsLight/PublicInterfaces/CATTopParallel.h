/**
* Class representing the operator that computes a wire parallel to another one on a skin body.
* <br>The CATTopParallel operator follows the global frame of the topological operators
* and satisfies the smart mechanism: the
* input bodies are not modified. A new resulting body is created, 
* possibly sharing data with the input bodies.
*<ul>
* <li>A CATTopParallel operator is created with the <tt>CATCreateTopParallel</tt> global function.
* It must be directly deleted with the usual C++ <tt>delete</tt> operator after use. It is not streamable. 
*<li>The computation is done by the <tt>Run</tt> method. 
*<li>The result is accessed with the <tt>GetResult</tt> method. If you do not want 
* to keep the resulting body, use the @href CATICGMContainer#Remove method to remove it from the 
* geometric factory, after the operator deletion.
*</ul>
