/**
 * Class to create a graphic primitive which geometry is enclosed
 * in a bounding element.
 * <b>Role</b>:
 *    The box can either be an Axis Aligned Bounding Box
 *    (AABB) or an Object Bounding Box (OBB).
 *     - The AABB is aligned on the 3D axis system and so, of easy use with the GP coordinates 
 *       system, that can be obtained by reading the Representation tree.
 *     - The OBB is the best bounding box enclosing an object, and it is built
 *       through the use of the convex hull of the GP.
 *
 *    Presently, the box is computed in the GP axis coordinate system
 *    and is an AABB.
 *
 *    We although store a Bounding Sphere. Box and sphere are separately
 *    computed and have no common parameters, but are both enclosing the GP's
 *    geometry.
 *
 *    Don't worry about how to build it... The GP that inherits from this GP
 *    have to update the box included in this object, with the provided methods.
 *    As for the children, we have a provided method to retrieve tesselation
 *    parameters. This method will only be efficient in the subclasses that
 *    have overloaded it.
