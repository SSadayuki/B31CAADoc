/**
* Class defining the topological operator that fills a space defined by a set of wires.
* <br> The wires must define a closed area and be connected.
* Continuity criteria can be specified: G0, G1, or G2 if the supporting surfaces of the wire
* are given, G0 otherwise. The supporting surfaces must be coherent to allow the operator to
* compute a G1 or G2 continuity.
* If the given continuity constraints are not compatible, the fill result will not
* satisfy the continuity contraints. 
* If the given continuity constraints define a too scattered set of normals, the shape of
* the fill result may not be correct.  It is also possible to have no result.  
* 
* <br>The CATICGMPowerFill operator creates the resulting filling skin body
* separately from the inputs: the wires of the input bodies are not used to define the topology
* of the resulting fill body.  
*<ul>
* <li>A CATICGMPowerFill operator is created with the <tt>CATCGMCreatePowerFill</tt> global function.
* It must be directly released with the Release method. It is is not streamable. 
*<li>Options can be specified with the <tt>SetXxx</tt> methods, before
* asking for the computation with the <tt>Run</tt> method 
*<li>The result is accessed with the <tt>GetResult</tt> method. If you do not want 
* to keep the resulting body, use the @href CATICGMContainer#Remove method to remove it from the 
* geometric factory.
* <li>The journal corresponding to the fill operation is not yet implemented.
