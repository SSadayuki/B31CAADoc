* Class representing the topological operator that transforms a CATBody.
* <br>
* It follows the use frame of all operator and satisfies to the smart mechanism: the
* input body is not modified. A new resulting body is created, 
* possibly sharing data with the input one.
*<ul>
* <li>A CATICGMDynTransformation is created with the <tt>CATCGMCreateDynTransformation</tt> global function:
* It must be
* directly released with the <tt>Release</tt> method.
* It is not streamable. 
*<li>Options can be precised with the <tt>SetXxx</tt> methods, before
* asking for the computation with the <tt>Run</tt> method. In particular, the operator can be re-use to
* transform the same body with different transformations; in this case, you can precise another journal to
* be filled, with the <tt>SetNewJournal</tt> method. 
*<li>The result is accessed with the <tt>GetResult</tt> method. 
*</ul>
* This operator is optimized and simplified with regards to the @href CATTransfoManager : The CATDynTransfomation
* operator chooses the best way to call the CATTransfoManager. In another way, the CATTransfoManager provides more
* options.
