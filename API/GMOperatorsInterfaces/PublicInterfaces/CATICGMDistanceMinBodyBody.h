 * This API has been deprecated. 
 * Please use the new API instead:
 *   CATICGMDistanceBodyBody (created using CATCGMCreateDistanceBodyBodyOp)
 *
 * Class defining the operator that computes the minimum distance between two bodies.
 * To use the operator:
 * <ul><li>Create it with the <tt>CATCGMCreateDistanceMinTopo</tt> global function,
 * <li>Set parameters to tune its use (<tt>ADVANCED</tt> mode),
 * <li>Run the operator (<tt>ADVANCED</tt> mode),
 * <li>Retrieve the results with the <tt>Get</tt> methods, 
 * <li>If needed, change an input body and rerun the modified operator (<tt>ADVANCED</tt> mode),
 * <li>Release the operator with the <tt>Release</tt> method after use.
 * </ul>
 * Note: If the operator is used in <tt>BASIC</tt> mode, the operation is directly computed at the 
 * operator creation. So that you directly access the result without <tt>Run</tt>ning the operator.
 * But you cannot tune the parameters, nor reuse it in another run with other input bodies.
