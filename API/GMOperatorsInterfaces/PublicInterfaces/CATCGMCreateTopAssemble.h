* The operator only scans the shell domains. It can create closed shells.
* <br><b>Orientation</b>: The orientation of a resulting shell is the orientation of the first

* Even if a shell cannot be assembled,
* it is put in the resulting body. However, its orientation may have been changed,

* The operator only scans the wire domains. It can create closed wires.
* <br>Each input body each can contain several disconnected wires.
