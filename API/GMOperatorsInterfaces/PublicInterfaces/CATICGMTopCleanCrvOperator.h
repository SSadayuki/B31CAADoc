/**
 * Class defining the operator to clean a wire body.
 * <br>
 * The operator produces a wire topology that is at least (G0) continuous. More over, upon request, it can:
 *<ul>
 * <li> Enhance the continuity between edges up to the continuity in curvature (G2 continuity).
 * <li> Concatenate all the edges sharing vertices that are G2 continuous.
 * <li> Allow the continuity enhancement of the wire on a shell topology support (2D cleaning mode).
 *</ul>
 * The operator produces a new wire containing at most the same number of edges than the input wire.
 * The correction is controlled by the user. The operator can correct:
 * <ul>
 *  <ul><li>Point discontinuities between edges, according to a point discontinuity criterion.
 *    All point discontinuity gaps less than this criterion are corrected to be set to the standard G0 gap 
 * (see @href CATGeoFactory#GetResolution ).
 *  <li> Tangency between edges, according to a tangency discontinuity criterion.
 *    The tangency discontinuity angles less than this criterion are corrected to be set to the standard G1 angle
 * (see @href CATGeoFactory#GetResolution ).
 *  <li>Curvature between edges, according to a curvature vector discontinuity criterion. 
 * Let <tt>C1</tt> and <tt>C2</tt> be the curvature vectors to edges <tt>E1</tt>, <tt>E2</tt> incident to vertex <tt>V</tt>.
 * <br>Define <tt>R = |C1 - C2 | / max (|C1|,|C2|)</tt> to be the curvature vector ratio.
 * If <tt>R</tt> is greater than <tt>(1-iCurvatureRatio)/iCurvatureRatio</tt>, G2 continuity will 
 * be corrected to the standard G2 value (see @href CATGeoFactory#GetResolution ).
 *  <li>Small edges to delete, according to an edge length criterion, upon request.
 * </ul>
 *  More over after these corrections, the operator can merge edges that are connected by vertices 
 * that are continuous in curvature.
 * <br>
 * These operations can be driven in two control modes @href CatTopCleanCrvPriorityMode :
 * <ul>
 *  <li>@href CatTopCleanCrvPriorityMode#CatTopCleanCrvContinuity : The priority is given to continuity order achievement, regardless of the geometric deformation.
 *    Some important deformations between the input body and the result may appear.
 *  <li>@href CatTopCleanCrvPriorityMode#CatTopCleanCrvDeformation : The process is run with an additional constraint of maximum deformation around the input wire. 
 *    In this case, it can happen that some required continuity constraints are not reached, producing
 * an error in the <tt>Run</tt> method.
 * </ul> 
 * This operator follows the general scheme of the topological operators:
 * <ul>
 *<li> Creates the operator with the <tt>CATCGMCreateTopCleanCrvOperator</tt> global function, which defines
 * the wire to clean
 *<li> Sets the cleaning parameters
 *<li> Runs with the <tt>Run</tt> method. In case of maximum deformation control mode, if the operator does not find
 * any solution satisfying all the constraints, an error is thrown. 
 *<li> Gets the result body by the <tt>GetResult</tt> method. 
 * The result body contains at most the same number of edges 
 * than the input one. Moreover, one can access to the maximum deformation
 * between the input body and the result. 
 *<li> Release the operator with the <tt>Release</tt> method after use.
 *</ul>
 * Remark : In case of 2D cleaning mode (on shell), the continuity at transition vertices between two
 * faces could not be enhanced beyond the continuity between both faces. Indeed, the treatment does not
 * enhance the continuity of the shell.
 * </ul>
